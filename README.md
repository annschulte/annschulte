# Hi, I'm Ann
#### I'm a software developer based out of Omaha, NE. I'd describe myself as a builder. I love the process of creating, whether it be in the form of new technology or a diy home project. I get a lot of enjoyment from using my hands and creativity.

🧱 I’m currently building  [Plexus](https://plexusaero.space/)

❤️ I love family, dogs and diy projects.
